## Milestone: v1.6 — California City Expansion

**Shipped:** 2026-06-06
**Phases:** 6 | **Plans:** 20 | **Timeline:** 3 days (2026-06-04 → 2026-06-06)

### What Was Built

- Sacramento loaded in < 1 day via existing loadSacramentoCSV.js — fastest phase in milestone because the loader already existed
- Oakland (GPF biennial ~$800M/yr) and San Jose (GF ~$1.7B) loaded via pdfplumber; 50 enrichment rows; all 6 criteria PASS
- Long Beach (GF $634M–$773M, Port excluded) and Bakersfield (GF $412–427M, scope corrected inline) loaded; Bakersfield scope fix discovered and applied during verification
- Fresno (GF ~$483M, enterprise excluded) and Riverside (biennial ~$1.45B/yr, RPU excluded) loaded; revenue deferred for both
- Anaheim (GF $491–530M) and Santa Ana (GF $404–424M) loaded with revenue and enrichment; all 6 criteria PASS
- Longview TX revenue enrichment closed as carry-forward (2 corrupted names fixed, 36 rows added in < 1 day)

### What Worked

- **Pre-written loaders eliminate phases**: Sacramento's `loadSacramentoCSV.js` and Longview's carry-forward took < 1 day combined. Investing in reusable loaders during prior phases compresses future milestone scope dramatically.
- **Pattern convergence**: pdfplumber + extractCity.py + processCity.js is now a well-worn pattern. Phases 29–31 executed faster than Phases 26–28 because the team knew exactly what to build.
- **Inline scope fixes during verification**: Bakersfield's operating/revenue scope mismatch (all-funds ~$762M vs GF revenue ~$370M) was caught and fixed during Phase 29-04 enrichment/verification — before shipping. Scope parity checks before enrichment are now standard.
- **Analytical cost estimation over `--dry-run`**: Discovered that `enrichCategories.js --dry-run` still calls the AI API (only skips DB write), defeating the cost gate. Analytical estimation from DB category counts + token pricing became the standard approach — accurate and free.
- **$0.10 per-city-pair enrichment gate held**: Every enrichment phase came in under $0.10 combined (Sacramento $0, Oakland+San Jose ~$0.03, Long Beach+Bakersfield $0.0666, Fresno+Riverside ~$0.03, Anaheim+Santa Ana ~$0.05).

### What Was Inefficient

- **Phase 28 status not updated in real-time**: ROADMAP.md showed "3/4 plans / In Progress" after 28-04 completed, causing confusion at milestone close. ROADMAP and PROJECT.md should be updated as each plan completes, not deferred.
- **`enrichCategories.js --city` mode resets progress file**: Single-city mode resets `.enrichment-progress.json` on each run, causing Phase 31 to overwrite Anaheim data with Santa Ana data. Required manual consolidation. The `--all` mode accumulates properly; DB is the authoritative source of truth.
- **Oakland revenue deferred unexpectedly**: Research indicated Oakland might have extractable revenue data, but the live source (OpenGov embedded chart) turned out not to be pdfplumber-accessible. A pre-phase source verification step could surface this earlier.

### Patterns Established

- **Scope parity check before enrichment**: Before marking a phase complete, verify that operating and revenue use the same fund scope (GF vs all-funds). A 2x ratio is a red flag.
- **Analytical enrichment cost estimation**: Query DB for unique name_keys per city, multiply by ~$0.00148/call (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 as of June 2026), sum across cities. More accurate than `--dry-run` and costs nothing.
- **`--city` mode resets progress; DB is truth**: For multi-city enrichment runs, use `--all` mode or manually consolidate after individual runs. Always verify enrichment completeness via DB query, not progress file.
- **pdfplumber + extractCity.py + processCity.js**: The CA PDF pipeline pattern is mature. New city phases can be planned confidently at 3–4 plans (seed → extract → load → enrich+verify).

### Key Lessons

1. **Invest in shared loaders early**: Sacramento took < 1 day because the loader was pre-written. Every reusable loader eliminates a milestone phase. When a data source is identified, write the loader even if loading is deferred.
2. **Verify revenue source accessibility before planning**: Oakland revenue was planned but the source format (OpenGov embedded chart) wasn't accessible via pdfplumber. A 30-minute pre-research step per city would catch this.
3. **ROADMAP is stale if not updated per-plan**: The milestone close revealed ROADMAP.md showing Phase 28 as "3/4 plans / In Progress" when it was complete. Update ROADMAP progress table immediately after each plan completes.
4. **Enterprise fund scope matters for comparability**: The operating/revenue comparison is only meaningful when both use the same scope. GF-to-GF or all-funds-to-all-funds — mixing scopes (as happened with Bakersfield) creates a misleading ~2x ratio.

### Cost Observations

- Enrichment cost: ~$0.16 total across 9 cities (well under $5 threshold)
- No expensive PDF vision pipeline runs (all CA cities used pdfplumber text extraction)
- Notable: Sacramento was $0 in enrichment (pre-existing rows from research phase)

## Cross-Milestone Trends

### Process Evolution

| Milestone | Phases | Plans | Timeline | Key Change |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|------------|
| v1.0 | 4 | 9 | 1 day | GSD system initialized |
| v1.1 | 3 | 9 | 12 days | Generic loaders (Socrata, XLSX, PDF vision) |
| v1.2 | 3 | 9 | 18 days | pdftotext pipeline for text-based PDFs |
| v1.3 | 4 | 9 | 1 day | Revenue + enrichment patterns mature |
| v1.4 | 2 | 8 | 1 day | CA expansion (Socrata + CSV generalize) |
| v1.5 | 9 | 24 | 3 days | OR pdfplumber pipeline established; all-funds scope fix |
| v1.6 | 6 | 20 | 3 days | CA pdfplumber pattern proven across 9 cities |

### Top Lessons (Verified Across Milestones)

1. **Generic loaders compress future milestones**: Every milestone that invested in a reusable loader (Socrata v1.1, XLSX v1.1, pdfplumber v1.5) made subsequent milestones faster. This compounds — v1.6 ran in 3 days because v1.5 proved the pdfplumber pattern.
2. **Scope mismatches are correctness issues, not just cosmetic**: Bakersfield (v1.6) and LA revenue (v1.5) both had scope mismatches caught during verification. A "scope parity check" before enrichment is now standard.
3. **Human UAT checkpoints catch real issues**: Every milestone has had at least one real issue surfaced during human verification that automated checks missed (LA revenue $44.6B in v1.5; Bakersfield operating/revenue ratio in v1.6).
